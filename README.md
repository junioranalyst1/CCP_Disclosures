# CCP Quantitative Disclosures

While WFE is a federation of exchanges and CCPs, the WFE Statistics Portal currently only collects exchange-related market indicators. This not only affects WFE’s leadership as a source of industry research and statistics, but it also hinders our aim of shedding light on the important role of CCPs in the economy. For this reason, as part of its Workplan for 2020, WFE will incorporate selected CCP indicators to the WFE database.

The Quantitative Disclosures released on a quarterly basis by CCPs include, among other indicators, levels of default fund and of variation and initial margins, disaggregated by asset class and by clearing service. Having this information consolidated in a single place and updated on a regular basis is essential for conducting research and analysis on the evolution of the clearing industry. In particular, such data is fundamental for supporting WFE’s advocacy programmes and informing discussions with policymakers and other stakeholders.
